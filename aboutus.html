                <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
                <p>We have provided a interface where users can encrypt their secret data. Here, they can get a detailed information about cryptogrphy. As we all know that how much the need of cyber security is necessary in our daily life. So, we contributed a web page interface where users can easily understand the concept of cryptography and can also have a hands-on experience by using our CryptoSite, a cryptographic website.</p>
                <h1>About Us:</h1>
                <p>This cryptographic project has been developed by our core Team consisting of students of The Neotia University under The Department of Computer Science and Engineering specialized in Cyber Security. The developers included: [Backend Developers]: Soumyadeep Ghosh and Soumita Haldar and [Frontend Developers]: Susmita Mondal and Aishi Das</p>
